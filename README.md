# Summary
GGP Vault is a protocol that allows you to earn yield on your idle GGP.  

There is currently no way for people holding GGP to earn yield on their tokens without running a validator node. GGP Vault changes this. Anyone holding GGP is able to stake their GGP to receive xGGP which participates in validator rewards.
